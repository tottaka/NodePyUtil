# NodePyUtil
A C# WinForms(.NET Framework 4.6.1) GUI utility for interfacing with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) running MicroPython.
Sorry for the sloppy code - if you would like to contribute to this project/clean it up, please do not hesitate!
I made this quick & dirty project as an alternative to the [Adafruit MicroPython Tool](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy).
